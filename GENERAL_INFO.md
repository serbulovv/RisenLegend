# Welcome to Risen Legend!
This repository is a pet project. This repository is an RPG game.


## Motivation
 The goal of the game is to pass level after level and kill the monsters in each level. When the last monster of the dungeon is defeated, the next level will open. From each monster things fall, parts of things and other finds that can be used in crafting or other cool things. In order to pass all the monsters, you must make your character as flexible and strong as possible in order to withstand a large amount of damage, as well as inflict it in a large volume.

## Useful tips
### Start of the game
Your task is to get acquainted with the mechanics of the game, the initial monsters and craft the first basic artifacts.
### General tips
 1) Try to fight with a large number of monsters, because the reward will be more.
 2) Choose your tactics for each monster. Someone needs to deal a lot of critical damage, and against someone you just need to survive in a long fight, so your hero will need a lot of HP. Be flexible for each monster.
 3) In the process of killing monsters, a unique type of monster can be encountered that will bring you unique rewards. Therefore, beat the mobs more often.
